This is a small project to refresh the basics of APIs.
It contains a simple User model.
The key point of the project was being able to use the CRUD operations using Insomnia.

API Endpoints:

GET: /api/users/ (get all the users)

POST: /api/users/ (create a new user)

GET: /api/users/<id>/ (get a specific user)

PUT: /api/users/<id>/ (updates a specific user)

DELETE: /api/users<id>/ (deletes a specific user)
